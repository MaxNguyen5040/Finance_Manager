# Finance_Manager

My budget spreadsheet is essentially a google sheet - I wanted to fix that! While inputting data into google sheets is fine, trying to analyze that data is really tough. Python seems a lot easier! Since it's not pulling data from anywhere, anyone can use it to track their budgets!

Development Progress:
 - I've gotten most of the foundation of the app set!
 - Authentication and security is pretty fleshed out as well.
   
Future Steps:
 - My next step will be trying to add a direct import of the csv spreadsheet I used to use, and analyze trends from that!
